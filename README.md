## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I’m Ahmed Mohsen, a passionate Flutter developer based in Egypt, focused on building clean, scalable mobile apps that solve real-world problems.

🚀 Currently working on Emdad, a platform that streamlines communication between pharmacies and storage providers.

🧠 Continuously learning — exploring Cubit/Bloc, clean architecture, and design patterns like MVVM and MVC to build better structured and testable code.

💡 I have hands-on experience with Flutter, some background in Android (Kotlin), and a growing interest in Angular for web development.

💬 I love writing maintainable code, collaborating with other devs, and sipping coffee while debugging ☕.

🌍 Open to remote roles, freelance gigs, or just connecting with fellow developers!

Let’s build something great together!
